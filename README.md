# Check-ping
Short script to check pings from servers that you want and drawing this pings to csv file.

It's simple script written in Bash. 
How to use my app? It's simple! First you have to make a list.txt file, where you can add servers that you want to check.
It could looks like this:
    google.pl
    wp.pl
    fakeserverthatnotexist.rotfl
,then you are running this app and you can find a new file named status.csv, where you can see somethin like that:
    google.pl                    | works fine!
    wp.pl                        | works fine!
    fakeserverthatnotexist.rotfl | doesn't work :(




#Anyone can use this code, ofc for free.
